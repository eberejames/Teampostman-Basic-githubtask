I can't talk about myself without talking about beauty.I am obsessed and passionate with anything “beauty” as well as aspire to have my own beauty brand. hence my journey into the beauty industry. My experience as a makeup artist over the past seven years has enabled me to gain strong communication skills and good customer relations with people. I have developed the ability to think critically and interact with clients, assisting clients who may need professional advice with making decisions for makeup application or product choice. In addition, I have been able to create quality social media content which drives sales and attracts new clients for brands that I work with. Sequel to this, i have trained and mentored over 500 students who are passionate about this craft
Recently i transitioned into tech (software testing).it's not been a smooth ride but i am enjoying it and can’t wait to become a full fledged Software tester
